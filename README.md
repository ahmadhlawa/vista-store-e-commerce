# Vista Store

Arabic RTL e-commerce storefront and administration platform for Vista Store.

> **Project status:** local development only. Nothing has been deployed.

Vista Store provides a public storefront for browsing products, managing a cart, guest
checkout, coupons, delivery areas, order tracking, editorial content, and static pages.
Its admin workspace manages the catalogue, media, orders, coupons, delivery areas, home
content, pages, articles, settings, administrator accounts, audit history, and invoices.

Cash on delivery and manual payment are supported. Online card payments are not included.
An immutable, sequential invoice is created automatically when an order is first confirmed.

## Platform

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | React and Vite |
| Backend | FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic |
| Local database | SQLite |
| Production database | MySQL-compatible |
| Media storage | Local storage or Cloudflare R2 |

The active profile is [Vista Store](instance/vista-store.yaml): `Vista Store` / `متجر فيستا`,
using the verified Vista colour identity and logo. `ILS` / `₪` remains the documented
preview default only; it must be confirmed by the owner before real orders are accepted.

## Local setup

Requires Python 3.12+ and Node.js 18+.

```powershell
cd D:\Project\vista-store-e-commerce\backend

as the dedicated Vista Store application. Historical release and architecture records are
retained for provenance; they are not part of the current onboarding path.
