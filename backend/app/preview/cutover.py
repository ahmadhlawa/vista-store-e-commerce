"""Client-data cutover: look before you purge, and keep what turned out to be real.

A preview batch is a loan of demonstration content. The moment real client data arrives
it has to be handed back — but by then the owner has usually been working inside the
instance, and something genuinely theirs may have arrived *through* the batch: a hero
slide they asked us to load, a banner that turned out to be their real artwork, an image
they now depend on. A blind `purge --confirm` would take those with it.

Three capabilities, deliberately separate operator actions:

* **plan** — read-only. What the purge would delete, what it would refuse to delete, and
  which pictures are at risk. It calls the purge's own dry run, so it cannot promise
  something the purge would not do.
* **preserve** — an explicit, targeted promotion. The row stays exactly where it is; only
  the batch's *claim* on it is dropped, so no later purge considers it. The media the row
  displays is promoted with it, because a slide without its picture is not preserved.
* **verify** — read-only. Does the database still look like a working, bootstrapped
  store once the demo content is gone?

Nothing here imports client data, and nothing here deletes anything. Purging stays with
`preview_cli purge --confirm`, importing stays with `preview_cli seed`.
