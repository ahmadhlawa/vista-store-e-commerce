"""Migration DDL ordering, verified against a real MySQL 8 server.

MySQL requires every foreign key to be backed by an index, and refuses to drop
the last index a constraint can use:

    ERROR 1553: Cannot drop index 'uq_invoices_order_id':
                needed in a foreign key constraint

Revision 0003 creates `invoices` with a foreign key on `order_id` and a unique
constraint on the same column in one CREATE TABLE. InnoDB satisfies the foreign
key with that unique index and creates no second one, so the unique index is the
only thing holding the constraint up. Revision 0005 then replaces the unique
constraint with a plain index, because an order may have more than one invoice
once replacements exist — and the order in which it does that decides whether
MySQL accepts the migration at all.

SQLite never sees this: `batch_alter_table` rebuilds the table instead of issuing
DROP INDEX, and SQLite does not require an index behind a foreign key. So the
whole SQLite suite can pass while MySQL cannot migrate at all, which is exactly
what happened.

These tests walk the revisions one at a time rather than jumping to head, so a
failure names the boundary that broke.
