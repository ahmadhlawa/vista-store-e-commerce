# Future MySQL migration

**Status: exercised in CI, never deployed.** The models, types and dependencies were
chosen so that moving to MySQL 8 is a configuration change rather than a rewrite, and
since 0.3.0-rc.1 `.github/workflows/mysql-compatibility.yml` proves that against a real —
but ephemeral — MySQL 8 service on every relevant push: Alembic upgrades an empty
database to head, the migrated schema matches the models, every table is InnoDB/utf8mb4,
the client lifecycle runs and is idempotent, the demo seed runs twice without changing a
row count, and `Decimal` money, JSON config, foreign keys, unique constraints and guest
checkout all behave.

That is a compatibility proof, not a deployment. **No MySQL server outside GitHub Actions
has ever been contacted from this repository**, and the operational checklist below —
charset, users, privileges, backups, connection pooling — is still work to be done on the
day a client instance actually moves.

> The CI gate installs `pip install -e ".[dev,mysql]"`. The `mysql` extra pulls
> `PyMySQL[rsa]`, which MySQL 8 needs for its default `caching_sha2_password`
> authentication. A real MySQL deployment needs the same extra.

One database and one database user per client instance. No shared database, ever.

## What is already portable

| Decision | Why it helps |
| --- | --- |
| SQLAlchemy 2.x ORM throughout | No hand-written SQL to port. There are no raw `text()` queries in application code |
| `PyMySQL` already a declared dependency | No dependency change is needed |
| Enum-like columns are `String(32)` validated by Pydantic | No native `ENUM` columns, so adding a status value stays a code change rather than a schema migration |
| Money is `Numeric(12,2)` with Python `Decimal` | Maps cleanly to MySQL `DECIMAL(12,2)`; no float rounding |
| Timestamps are naive UTC `DateTime` | Maps to `DATETIME`; no timezone semantics to reconcile |
| `JSON` used in only two places | `home_sections.config` and `audit_logs.meta` — MySQL 8 has native JSON |
| Alembic owns the schema | The same revision builds MySQL; `create_all` is only used for throwaway test databases |
| Relative-path anchoring is SQLite-only | `sqlalchemy_url()` passes any non-SQLite URL through untouched |

## Switching

Only `DATABASE_URL` changes:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://commerce_user:<password>@127.0.0.1:3306/commerce_database
```

`.env.example` already carries this as a commented example. Then:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## What to verify on a real server — CI does not do any of this

**1 — Charset and collation.** Create the database explicitly; do not rely on the server
default. The content is Arabic and needs full Unicode:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE commerce_CLIENT_SLUG
  CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
  COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

`utf8` in MySQL is not UTF-8. It must be `utf8mb4`, or four-byte characters — including
emoji in product descriptions — are silently corrupted.

**2 — Index key length.** MySQL limits index key length in bytes, and `utf8mb4` uses up to
four bytes per character. Unique indexes on long slug columns (`products.slug` is
`String(260)`) may exceed the limit and need a prefix index or a shorter column. This is
the single most likely place `alembic upgrade head` fails on a fresh MySQL database.

**3 — Arabic slugs.** Products named in Arabic get Arabic slugs. Confirm they round-trip
through MySQL, that the unique index behaves under `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, and note that
this collation is case- and accent-insensitive, so two slugs differing only in case would
now collide where SQLite allowed both.

**4 — Check constraints.** MySQL 8.0.16+ enforces `CHECK` constraints; earlier versions
parse and ignore them. Confirm the guarantees in
[database-model.md](database-model.md) — non-negative totals, positive quantities, a
package not containing itself — are actually enforced, and pin the server version.

**5 — Strict mode.** Run with `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`. Without it MySQL truncates
over-length values instead of raising, which would silently corrupt data that SQLite
accepted.

**6 — Search.** `Product.search_text` with `LIKE '%term%'` cannot use an index. On MySQL,
add a `FULLTEXT` index and adapt the catalog service query. Arabic full-text needs the
`ngram` parser or a normalisation strategy — verify recall against real product names
before promising search quality.

**7 — Transactions.** Use InnoDB. The order-creation path depends on real transactional
rollback to keep stock decrements and order rows consistent.

**8 — Connection pooling.** The SQLite engine sets `check_same_thread=False`, which is
SQLite-specific. For MySQL, configure `pool_size`, `max_overflow` and especially
`pool_pre_ping=True`, or connections idle past `wait_timeout` surface as
"MySQL server has gone away".

**9 — Run the suite against MySQL.** The pytest suite builds SQLite databases. Point it at
a scratch MySQL database and run it before trusting the migration. Expect the first run to
find something.

## Migrating existing data

For a store that already has live SQLite data, the schema is only half the job:

1. Back up both the database file and the media directory.
2. Build the MySQL schema with `alembic upgrade head` — never by dumping SQLite DDL.
3. Move rows with a script that goes through SQLAlchemy models, so `Decimal`, `DateTime`
   and `JSON` values are converted by the same code that wrote them. A raw
   `.dump` / `mysql <` pipeline will produce subtly wrong types.
4. Reset auto-increment counters, then verify row counts per table, a sample of order
   totals, and that media URLs still resolve.
5. Keep the SQLite file until the MySQL instance has been verified in use.

## Out of scope

Provisioning the server, replication, managed hosting and tuning are deployment concerns
and are not covered by this repository.
